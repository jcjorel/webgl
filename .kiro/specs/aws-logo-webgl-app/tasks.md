# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Set up project structure and basic HTML foundation



  - Create project directory structure with index.html, app.js, and assets folder
  - Implement basic HTML template with responsive container and Three.js script imports
  - Set up CSS for full-screen background and container styling
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 6.1_

- [ ] 2. Fetch current AMZN stock value and generate desert background
  - Use Perplexity MCP Server to retrieve current AMZN stock price in USD format
  - Use AWS Nova Canvas to generate desert background image (1920x1088) with colorful supernatural vegetation
  - Save generated background as 'desert-background.png' in assets folder
  - _Requirements: 3.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 3. Initialize Three.js scene and WebGL renderer
  - Create Three.js scene, perspective camera, and WebGL renderer with alpha transparency
  - Configure camera position, field of view, and aspect ratio for optimal viewing
  - Set up renderer with antialias and proper canvas sizing
  - Implement window resize handling for responsive behavior
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 6.1, 6.3_

- [ ] 4. Implement OrbitControls for mouse interaction
  - Import and initialize OrbitControls from Three.js addons
  - Configure controls with damping, zoom, and pan settings
  - Set up proper camera target and initial position
  - Test mouse orbit, zoom, and pan functionality
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 5. Create AWS logo 3D object with texture mapping
  - Load AWS logo PNG image as Three.js texture
  - Create plane geometry with appropriate dimensions for logo display
  - Apply texture to material with transparency support
  - Position logo mesh in scene center for optimal viewing
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 1.4_

- [ ] 6. Implement continuous logo rotation animation
  - Create animation loop using requestAnimationFrame
  - Add smooth rotation to logo mesh on Y-axis
  - Ensure rotation continues during mouse interaction
  - Maintain consistent rotation speed and smoothness
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 7. Create and position AMZN stock value display
  - Create 3D text geometry or textured plane for stock value display
  - Format stock value as "AMZN: $XXX.XX" using fetched price
  - Position text below the logo mesh
  - Apply white color material for visibility against background
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 8. Synchronize stock text rotation with logo
  - Group logo and stock text meshes together or implement synchronized rotation
  - Ensure stock text rotates as unified element with logo
  - Test rotation synchronization during mouse interaction
  - Verify text remains properly positioned relative to logo
  - _Requirements: 3.2_

- [ ] 9. Integrate responsive desert background
  - Apply desert background image to HTML container using CSS
  - Configure background-size: cover and background-position: center
  - Test background scaling across different window sizes
  - Ensure background doesn't interfere with 3D scene visibility
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 10. Set up Python HTTP server and test deployment
  - Create Python server script to serve application on port 8054
  - Test server startup and file serving functionality
  - Verify all static assets (HTML, JS, images) are properly served
  - Confirm application accessibility at localhost:8054
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 11. Implement comprehensive error handling
  - Add WebGL support detection with fallback messaging
  - Implement texture loading error handling with fallback materials
  - Add try-catch blocks for OrbitControls initialization
  - Create graceful degradation for missing assets or network issues
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3_

- [ ] 12. Optimize performance and conduct browser testing
  - Implement efficient rendering loop with proper frame rate management
  - Add memory management for geometries and materials
  - Test application in Chrome latest version with browser developer tools
  - Verify smooth performance, consistent frame rates, and responsive behavior
  - Validate all requirements are met through comprehensive testing
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4_
