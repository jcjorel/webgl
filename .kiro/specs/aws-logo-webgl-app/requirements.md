# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines a WebGL micro application that displays the AWS logo as a rotating 3D object with real-time stock information and a custom desert background. The application will be a single web page served locally using Python's HTTP server, designed for Chrome browser with Three.js framework providing the 3D rendering capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a viewer, I want to see the AWS logo rotating in 3D space, so that I can observe an engaging visual presentation of the AWS brand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the web page loads THEN the system SHALL display the AWS logo PNG image as a 3D textured object
2. WHEN the application starts THEN the logo SHALL rotate continuously at a smooth, consistent speed
3. WHEN the logo is displayed THEN it SHALL maintain proper proportions and visual quality in 3D space
4. WHEN rendering the logo THEN the system SHALL use WebGL through Three.js framework

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control the 3D view with my mouse, so that I can examine the rotating logo from different angles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I move my mouse while holding the left button THEN the system SHALL allow me to orbit around the logo
2. WHEN I use the mouse wheel THEN the system SHALL zoom in and out of the scene
3. WHEN I interact with mouse controls THEN the logo rotation SHALL continue uninterrupted
4. WHEN mouse controls are active THEN the system SHALL use OrbitControls from Three.js

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a viewer, I want to see the current AMZN stock value displayed with the logo, so that I can view real-time financial information alongside the AWS branding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display the current AMZN stock price in USD format
2. WHEN the logo rotates THEN the stock value text SHALL rotate with the logo as a unified element
3. WHEN displaying the stock value THEN it SHALL be positioned below the rotating logo
4. WHEN showing the price THEN the system SHALL use the most recent AMZN stock value as a hardcoded value

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a viewer, I want to see a fantastical desert background, so that I can enjoy an immersive and visually appealing environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display a desert background with colorful supernatural vegetation
2. WHEN the browser window is resized THEN the background image SHALL automatically fit the page size
3. WHEN displaying the background THEN it SHALL use the full resolution (1920x1088) and scale appropriately
4. WHEN rendering the scene THEN the background SHALL not interfere with the 3D logo visibility

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application served via Python HTTP server, so that I can easily test and demonstrate the application locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the server THEN the system SHALL serve the web page on port 8054
2. WHEN accessing the application THEN it SHALL be available at localhost:8054
3. WHEN serving files THEN the system SHALL use Python's simple HTTP server
4. WHEN the server runs THEN all static assets SHALL be properly served

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user with Chrome browser, I want the application to work optimally, so that I can experience smooth performance and full feature compatibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Chrome latest version THEN all WebGL features SHALL function correctly
2. WHEN loading the page THEN Three.js and OrbitControls SHALL load and initialize properly
3. WHEN running the application THEN performance SHALL be smooth with consistent frame rates
4. WHEN testing the solution THEN browser tools SHALL be used for validation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the implementation to follow KISS principles, so that the code remains simple, maintainable, and focused on core functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing features THEN the system SHALL use the simplest approach that meets requirements
2. WHEN writing code THEN unnecessary complexity SHALL be avoided
3. WHEN structuring the application THEN it SHALL consist of minimal, essential components only
4. WHEN adding functionality THEN each feature SHALL serve a specific, defined purpose
