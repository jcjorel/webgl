Generate a background image of a desert with colorful supernatural vegetals. Under the rotating logo and rotating with it, place a hardcoded AMZN stock value in $ (fetch today stock value as hardcoded value).

Use Three.js framework. Use a python simple http server to serve the web page. Background image must fit the web page size. Design it for Chrome latest version browser.
