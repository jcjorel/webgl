Create a single Web page containing a WebGL micro application that makes the supplied AWS image PNG slowly rotating in solid 3D with optional mouse control. Generate a background image of a desert with factastical colorful supernatural vegetals. Under the rotating logo and rotating with it, place a hardcoded AMZN stock value in $ (fetch today stock value as hardcoded value).

Use Three.js framework. Use a python simple http server to serve the web page (port 8054). Background image must fit automatically the web page size (real image size 1920x1088). 
Design it for Chrome latest version browser.

To test the solution, you will use browser tool. 
Use Perplexity MCP Server to fetch the current AMZN stock value.
Use Perplexity MCP Server to get URLs for OrbitControl and Three.js packages. 
Use Context7 for right usage of latest version of Three.js and OrbitControl.
Use AWS Nova canvas to generate images.
