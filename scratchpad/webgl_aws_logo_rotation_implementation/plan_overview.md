# WebGL AWS Logo Rotation Implementation Plan

⚠️ CRITICAL: CODING ASSISTANT MUST READ THESE DOCUMENTATION FILES COMPLETELY BEFORE EXECUTING ANY TASKS IN THIS PLAN

## Documentation Files

This implementation is based on the requirements in:
- `/home/jcjorel/demo/webgl/WORK_TODO.md` - Contains the main requirements for the WebGL application

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of a WebGL micro application that displays a rotating 3D AWS logo with a generated background image and AMZN stock value. The application follows the KISS (Keep It Simple & Stupid) principle while meeting all requirements.

### Core Requirements

1. **Create a WebGL application** using Three.js framework
2. **Rotate the AWS logo** in 3D with optional mouse control
3. **Generate a background image** of a desert with colorful supernatural plants
4. **Display AMZN stock value** below the rotating logo
5. **Serve the application** using a Python simple HTTP server
6. **Optimize for Chrome** latest version

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Three.js
- **Server**: Python simple HTTP server
- **MCP Servers**: 
  - Perplexity (to fetch AMZN stock value)
  - Nova Canvas (to generate the background image)
  - Puppeteer (to test the application)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Asset Generation and Collection
- Generate the desert background image with Nova Canvas
- Fetch current AMZN stock value using Perplexity

### Phase 2: Application Structure Setup
- Create the HTML file structure
- Set up Three.js boilerplate
- Configure the WebGL scene

### Phase 3: Core Functionality Implementation
- Create the 3D scene with the AWS logo
- Implement logo rotation animation
- Add AMZN stock value display
- Implement mouse controls
- Apply the generated background

### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement
- Start the Python HTTP server
- Test the application using Puppeteer
- Verify all requirements are met
- Make final adjustments as needed

## Implementation Plan Files

This implementation plan is divided into the following detailed files:

1. `plan_overview.md` (this file) - Overview of the implementation plan
2. `plan_progress.md` - Progress tracking for the implementation
3. `plan_phase1_assets.md` - Details for asset generation and collection
4. `plan_phase2_structure.md` - Application structure setup details
5. `plan_phase3_functionality.md` - Core functionality implementation details
6. `plan_phase4_testing.md` - Testing and refinement details

## Progress Tracking

Progress is tracked in the `plan_progress.md` file, which includes:
- Current status of each phase
- Completed tasks
- Pending tasks
- Any issues encountered

## Expected Outcome

A fully functional WebGL application that:
- Displays a rotating 3D AWS logo
- Has mouse control functionality
- Shows the current AMZN stock value
- Features a visually appealing desert background with supernatural vegetation
- Runs smoothly in Chrome browser
