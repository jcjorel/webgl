# Requirements and Constraints Analysis

## Source Statement Summary
The source document describes a WebGL micro application for creating a single web page featuring an AWS logo rotating on a 3D glass pane with mouse controls, set against an animated desert night scene with shooting stars and vaporwave elements. The application uses Three.js framework and includes a hardcoded AMZN stock value display.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

FR-001: The system SHALL create a single web page containing a WebGL micro application.

FR-002: The system SHALL display the supplied AWS image PNG slowly rotating on a glossy glass 3D pane implemented using Three.js MeshPhysicalMaterial with appropriate transparency, roughness, and clearcoat properties for realistic glass appearance.

FR-003: The system SHALL provide optional mouse control functionality for the AWS logo interaction.

FR-004: The system SHALL generate a background image of a desert at night with clear sky containing stars and fantastical colorful supernatural vegetation without cacti.

FR-005: The system SHALL animate the clear sky with realistic shooting stars/meteor shower effect.

FR-006: The system SHALL add vaporwave elements to the scene positioned randomly in both the foreground (between the camera and the AWS logo) and background (behind the AWS logo), creating depth layering in the 3D composition.

FR-007: The system SHALL display a hardcoded AMZN stock value of $230.34 USD under the rotating AWS logo.

FR-008: The system SHALL rotate the AMZN stock value display together with the AWS logo.

FR-009: The system SHALL implement shooting stars using Three.js particle systems with BufferGeometry and PointsMaterial, rendered as small white-colored lines with variable alpha channel based on distance simulation and motion blur effects.

FR-010: The system SHALL create shooting star trajectories from a plane few pixels above the background horizon line flowing quickly across the sky toward a vanishing virtual point above and behind the camera.

FR-011: The system SHALL implement vaporwave elements as randomly appearing animated shaded vertical lines originating from the generated image near ground level.

FR-012: The system SHALL render vaporwave lines as gradients that are fully transparent at the bottom and transition to semi-transparent with randomly selected target transparency and display duration.

FR-013: The system SHALL implement perspective scaling for vaporwave lines where lines positioned farther from the camera appear thinner and smaller than lines positioned closer to the camera.

FR-014: The system SHALL enforce height constraints for vaporwave lines such that lines closest to the camera SHALL NOT exceed 33% of the screen height.

FR-015: The system SHALL distribute vaporwave lines randomly across the scene depth, with some lines appearing in front of the AWS logo and others appearing behind the AWS logo to create proper depth perception.

FR-016: The system SHALL be tested using browser tool functionality with Chrome Developer tools for console log verification and runtime error monitoring.

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance Requirements
NFR-P-001: The system SHALL automatically fit the background image to the web page size from the real image size of 1920x1088 pixels.

NFR-P-002: The system SHALL maintain smooth animation performance for all rotating and animated elements.

#### Usability Requirements
NFR-U-001: The system SHALL be designed for Chrome latest version browser compatibility.

NFR-U-002: The system SHALL provide optional mouse control interaction using Three.js OrbitControls for camera manipulation, allowing users to orbit around, zoom, and pan the 3D scene containing the AWS logo and glass pane.

#### Reliability Requirements
NFR-R-001: The system SHALL serve the web page consistently using a Python simple HTTP server.

#### Maintainability Requirements
NFR-M-001: The system SHALL follow the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) design principle.

NFR-M-002: The system SHALL be implemented with clear separation between independent animated elements.

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
TC-001: The system SHALL use the Three.js framework (verified library ID: /mrdoob/three.js).

TC-002: The system SHALL use OrbitControls from Three.js for mouse interaction functionality.

TC-003: The system SHALL serve the application using a Python simple HTTP server on port 8054 with TCP reuse option enabled.

TC-004: The system SHALL render the background image as fixed (not rotating with the logo or subject to mouse control).

TC-005: The system SHALL implement shooting stars and vaporwave 3D WebGL canvas as independent elements not subject to mouse control.

TC-006: The system SHALL implement WebGL rendering using proper alpha blending and particle systems for realistic shooting star effects.

TC-007: The system SHALL use Three.js MeshPhysicalMaterial with clearcoat, roughness, and transmission properties for glass pane implementation.

TC-008: The system SHALL implement particle systems using Three.js BufferGeometry with position, velocity, and alpha attributes for efficient shooting star animation.

TC-009: The system SHALL use Three.js Scene, PerspectiveCamera, and WebGLRenderer with alpha: true for proper transparency handling.

TC-010: The system SHALL implement vaporwave line perspective scaling using z-depth calculations where line thickness and height are inversely proportional to distance from camera position, utilizing Three.js perspective camera view-space calculations with logarithmic depth buffer techniques for enhanced depth precision and implementing the scaling formula: scaleFactor = nearPlane / (nearPlane + z-depth), where z-depth represents the distance from camera to line position in world space coordinates.

TC-011: The system SHALL implement mathematical relationship between distance and scaling factor for vaporwave elements where scaling follows non-linear depth distribution patterns consistent with vaporwave aesthetic standards, ensuring dramatic perspective convergence using one-point or two-point perspective techniques.

TC-012: The system SHALL utilize Three.js depth texture methods for accurate z-depth calculations in vaporwave line rendering, enabling proper depth-based alpha blending and size interpolation across the 3D scene depth range.

### Business Constraints
BC-001: The hardcoded AMZN stock value SHALL be exactly $230.34 USD (current market value as of September 10, 2025).

BC-002: The system SHALL not implement real-time stock value fetching - the value must remain hardcoded.

### Design Constraints
DC-001: The system SHALL require one-time manual analysis of the generated Nova Canvas image to locate the polygon of the sky area for proper shooting star trajectory implementation.

DC-002: The background SHALL exclude cacti from the fantastical supernatural vegetation elements.

DC-003: The vaporwave elements SHALL be positioned close to the camera viewpoint and SHALL implement vaporwave aesthetic standards using neon colors (magenta, cyan, electric blue) with shader techniques for gradients and glowing effects to achieve authentic vaporwave visual presentation.

DC-004: The system SHALL strictly adhere to documented requirements without inflation or scope expansion during implementation.

### Resource Constraints
RSC-001: The system SHALL use specific MCP servers during build time: Perplexity MCP Server for AMZN stock value, Context7 MCP server for Three.js best practices, and AWS Nova Canvas MCP server for image generation.

RSC-002: Integration issues with Three.js or OrbitControls SHALL be resolved using Context7 and Perplexity MCP servers for enhanced reasoning.

RSC-003: When uncertain about implementation details or requirements clarification, the system SHALL prompt for additional information through appropriate questioning mechanisms.
