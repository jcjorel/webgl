# Requirements and Constraints Analysis

## Source Statement Summary
The source document describes a WebGL micro application for creating a single web page featuring an AWS logo rotating on a 3D glass pane with mouse controls, set against an animated desert night scene with shooting stars and vaporwave elements.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

FR-001: The system SHALL create a single web page containing a WebGL micro application.

FR-002: The system SHALL display the supplied AWS image PNG slowly rotating on a glossy glass 3D pane with realistic glass appearance including transparency, roughness, and clearcoat visual effects.

FR-003: The system SHALL provide optional mouse control functionality for the AWS logo interaction.

FR-004: The system SHALL display a pre-generated background image of a desert at night with clear sky containing stars and fantastical colorful supernatural vegetation without cacti.

FR-005: The system SHALL animate the clear sky with realistic shooting stars/meteor shower effect.

FR-006: The system SHALL add vaporwave elements positioned randomly behind the AWS logo, ensuring vaporwave elements never appear in front of the AWS logo to maintain proper visual hierarchy.

FR-007: The system SHALL display a hardcoded AMZN stock value under the rotating AWS logo (value fetched at build-time using Perplexity MCP Server and then hardcoded).

FR-008: The system SHALL rotate the AMZN stock value display together with the AWS logo.

FR-009: The system SHALL implement shooting stars rendered as small white-colored lines with variable alpha channel based on distance simulation and motion blur effects.

FR-010: The system SHALL create shooting star trajectories from a plane few pixels above the background horizon line flowing quickly across the sky toward a vanishing virtual point above and behind the camera.

FR-011: The system SHALL implement vaporwave elements as randomly appearing animated circular vapor bubbles originating near ground level and exhibiting ground-hugging vapor behavior.

FR-012: The system SHALL render vaporwave bubbles with transparency that starts fully transparent at initial appearance and transitions to semi-transparent with randomly selected target transparency and display duration, mimicking real vapor bubble behavior.

FR-013: The system SHALL implement perspective scaling for vaporwave bubbles where bubbles positioned farther from the camera appear smaller than bubbles positioned closer to the camera.

FR-014: The system SHALL enforce size constraints for vaporwave bubbles such that bubbles closest to the camera SHALL NOT exceed 33% of the screen height in diameter.

FR-015: The system SHALL distribute vaporwave bubbles randomly across the scene depth behind the AWS logo, ensuring that vaporwave elements NEVER appear in front of the AWS logo but always render behind it to maintain proper visual hierarchy and depth perception.

FR-016: The system SHALL animate vaporwave bubbles with a smooth growth effect where each bubble appears minimized (near zero diameter) and grows smoothly to its final size using easing functions for natural motion.

FR-017: The system SHALL be tested using browser tool functionality with Chrome Developer tools for console log verification and runtime error monitoring.

DC-004: The system SHALL strictly adhere to documented requirements without inflation or scope expansion during implementation.

DC-005: The system SHALL fetch the current AMZN stock value using Perplexity MCP Server at build-time (before implementation) and hardcode the fetched value into the application.

### Resource Constraints
RSC-001: The system SHALL use specific MCP servers during build time: Perplexity MCP Server for AMZN stock value, Context7 MCP server for Three.js best practices, and AWS Nova Canvas MCP server for image generation.

RSC-002: Integration issues with Three.js or OrbitControls SHALL be resolved using Context7 and Perplexity MCP servers for enhanced reasoning.
