## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

FR-001: The system SHALL create a single web page containing a WebGL micro application.

FR-003: The system SHALL provide optional mouse control functionality for the AWS logo interaction.

FR-004: The system SHALL generate a background image of a desert at night with clear sky containing stars and fantastical colorful supernatural vegetation without cacti.

FR-005: The system SHALL animate the clear sky with realistic shooting stars/meteor shower effect.

FR-006: The system SHALL add vaporwave elements to the scene positioned randomly in both the foreground (between the camera and the AWS logo) and background (behind the AWS logo), creating depth layering in the 3D composition.

FR-007: The system SHALL display a hardcoded AMZN stock value of $230.34 USD under the rotating AWS logo.

FR-008: The system SHALL rotate the AMZN stock value display together with the AWS logo.

FR-009: The system SHALL implement shooting stars using Three.js particle systems with BufferGeometry and PointsMaterial, rendered as small white-colored lines with variable alpha channel based on distance simulation and motion blur effects.

FR-010: The system SHALL create shooting star trajectories from a plane few pixels above the background horizon line flowing quickly across the sky toward a vanishing virtual point above and behind the camera.

FR-011: The system SHALL implement vaporwave elements as randomly appearing animated shaded vertical lines originating from the generated image near ground level.

FR-012: The system SHALL render vaporwave lines as gradients that are fully transparent at the bottom and transition to semi-transparent with randomly selected target transparency and display duration.

FR-013: The system SHALL implement perspective scaling for vaporwave lines where lines positioned farther from the camera appear thinner and smaller than lines positioned closer to the camera.

FR-014: The system SHALL enforce height constraints for vaporwave lines such that lines closest to the camera SHALL NOT exceed 33% of the screen height.

FR-015: The system SHALL distribute vaporwave lines randomly across the scene depth behind the AWS logo, ensuring that vaporwave elements NEVER appear in front of the AWS logo but always render behind it to maintain proper visual hierarchy and depth perception.

FR-016: The system SHALL animate vaporwave lines with a smooth growth effect where each line appears minimized (near zero height) and grows smoothly to its final size using easing functions for natural motion.

FR-017: The system SHALL be tested using browser tool functionality with Chrome Developer tools for console log verification and runtime error monitoring.

BC-001: The hardcoded AMZN stock value SHALL be exactly $230.34 USD (current market value as of September 10, 2025).

BC-002: The system SHALL not implement real-time stock value fetching - the value must remain hardcoded.

DC-004: The system SHALL strictly adhere to documented requirements without inflation or scope expansion during implementation.

### Resource Constraints
